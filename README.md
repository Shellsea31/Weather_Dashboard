# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description 

This week I was tasked to create a site that takes a users input and with the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) retrieves data for the city searched. It must feature content updated dynamically using Javascript. For this I mainly used functions, for loops and DOM selectors. On search users can see the overall daily forecast of the city they selected and a 5 day future forecast. 

The data from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) includes:

* City
* Date
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Wind Speeds
* UV index
* Icon representing the weather conditions
* Color varying for favorable, moderate, or severe uv index
